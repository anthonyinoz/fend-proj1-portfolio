                        <p class="section1_content"> Information Technology is an empowering discipline that touches the lives of everyone. That's what I love about it! The need for standards, quality, metrics and good governance processes around how it is developed and delivered is paramount. I have 20 years' experience developing, testing and supporting IT applications across diverse industries. See my full professional history <a href=#>here.</a>
